Please note this is a true beta and although it works on my projects your mileage may vary.\n\n### Contribute\nI'll be adding features periodically, however bug fixes, feature requests, and pull requests are all welcome.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/tgandrews/atom-easy-jsdoc/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/tgandrews/atom-easy-jsdoc#readme","_id":"atom-easy-jsdoc@4.8.0","_shasum":"846af5b8ac91ffe4271cd61b01be19a0327ac36a","_resolved":"file:../d-1161029-22459-1vfimff/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1161029-22459-1vfimff/package.tgz"}
